Teamwork Project Assignment for the JavaScript Basics Course @ SoftUni 
======================================================================

Design and implement **a client-side JavaScript game** by choice. It could be a well-known game like Chess, Backgammon, Solitaire, Minesweeper, Tetris, Xonix, Bridge-Belote or any jumping game (Super Mario, Bomberman etc.) or a game designed by your team.
You, as a team, are **free to decide** what frameworks, development tools and team collaboration tools will use. You might perform live meetings in SoftUni or at some other location, online meetings, use chat systems, organize mailing lists, Facebook groups, use project management tools, source control tools and any other technical and non-technical resources to build your project, but please **work in team**. Each team member should be able to **prove his or her contribution** at the project live defense. Remember that each team member will get **equal score** at the project public defense.

General Requirements:
=====================
•	**Use JavaScript** – the entire work should be implemented in JavaScript
•	**Client-side JavaScript application**, running in Internet
•	Ensure your application **works correctly** in the **latest versions of browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, IE, Opera, Safari
•	You **do not need to support** old browsers like IE9
•	**Work in team** – all team members should contribute
•	**Do not** use **engines** or **tools** that generate JavaScript code!

Additional Requirements
=======================
•	Follow the **best practices** for producing **high-quality code**: correct naming, correct formatting, etc.
